# my-first-website
This is my first website, created in 2022 during my HSC studies while learning HTML and CSS. It was an exciting task from my ICT teacher, Rashed Sir, sparking my passion for web development. Though simple and informal, it marks the start of my coding journey. I plan to enhance my work and publish a formal resume on GitHub soon.
